#### The Quest
In this quest there are two sides:
- a deep learning paper 🐉, a dangerous creature, chosen by our online community of deep learning aficionados
- a team of players ⚔️, who are brought together in a quest to defeat this paper

#### How do we defeat the paper?
During our virtual battle event we need to tackle different fronts. That's why we have different roles.
We need to squeeze it and imprison its essence inside a report artifact!! 
Moreover, we are going to make the resulting artifact available online. 
This way there will always be someone checking if it is still there.
It will never get out again! 

#### What can you do to help?
You can join us! By choosing any free vacancy on the sidebar, doing you part and joining us during 
our virtual battle. Please be prepared!

#### What are the roles?
The roles are described below. You don't need to read the full paper if you think it's not necessary for your
role. But always prepare notes/content because we will need those during our battle, and the mediator will ask your input.
